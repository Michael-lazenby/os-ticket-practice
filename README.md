<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<h3>Stage 1: Intake</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>
This is the stage where a new ticket is created. The most common way for a support ticket to be submitted is, through a form – such as the one shown here or by emailing an email address for IT tickets. In this form, the user provides their contact information, the issue, and a place to provide relevant details.

<h3>Stage 2: Assignment</h3>

<p>
When a support ticket is submitted, it can be assigned to a member of the IT team. You're able to change the severity of the ticket, and this determines its priority. For this ticket, the Priority was changed to “Emergency,” the SLA Plan was changed to “SEV-A,” and the Department was changed to “System Administrators.” The ticket was assigned to “Jane Doe,” who is an administrator in this scenario.</p>

<h3>Stage 3: Working the Issue</h3>
<p>
Since the ticket was assigned to the appropriate department, the IT staff can work on finding a solution to the issue. Whenever there is a change to the ticket, you can update the notes so other people in the department know what changes you have made.
                                                                   </p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5MToBkI.png" height="70%" width="70%"/>                                                              
<br />

<h3>Stage 4: Resolution</h3>

<p>
Once the issue has been resolved, the ticket can be closed. In the osTicket system, the ticket will move from the Open section to the Closed section at this stage. It is crucial to know where to find closed tickets since they can be browsed and used to find solutions to open tickets.
